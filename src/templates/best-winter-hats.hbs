                <li><strong>Pick a color palette.</strong> Decide whether you love neutrals, can&rsquo;t get enough of bright colors or need a little bit of both in your lifeâ€”that&rsquo;s a great starting point.</li>
                <li><strong>Know the warmest materials.</strong> Winter hats are available in a variety of materials, but they&rsquo;re not all created equal when it comes to staying warm during low temperatures. Look for wool, wool blends, faux (and real) fur linings and touches of leather.</li>
