                <li><strong>Soles with traction.</strong> Winter weather conditions can cause the ground to be slick, so it&rsquo;s important that winter boots have a sturdy sole that allows your feet to grip the ground.</li>
                <li><strong>Fur or faux fur lining.</strong> Boots lined in fur or faux fur provide an extra layer of warmth. This is crucial during colder months.</li>
                <li><strong>Weatherproofing.</strong> Whether it&rsquo;s raining, snowing or something in-between, your boots should be able to handle whatever Mother Nature throws at you. Look for waterproof, rustproof and insulated boots to protect your feet from the elements.</li>
                <li><strong>GORE-TEX<sup>&reg;</sup>.</strong> What is GORE-TEX<sup>&reg;</sup>?
